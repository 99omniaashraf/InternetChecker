# **Internet Checker**

This is a simple Bash script that checks your internet connection status and logs the results. It also provides desktop notifications using `notify-send`.

---

## **Features**
- Verifies if the internet is working.
- Distinguishes between DNS issues and complete disconnection.
- Logs connection status with timestamps in `logs/connection.log`.
- Displays notifications with appropriate icons.

---

## **Requirements**
1. A Linux environment.
2. `notify-send` installed for desktop notifications.

### **Install `notify-send`**
- **Ubuntu/Debian**:
  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install libnotify-bin
  ```
- **Fedora/Red Hat**:
  ```bash
  sudo dnf install libnotify
  ```
- **Arch Linux**:
  ```bash
  sudo pacman -S libnotify
  ```

   ```

2. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x checker.sh
   ```

3. Run the script:

## **Script Behavior**
- **Working Internet**: Logs "Internet is working." and displays a success notification.
- **DNS Issues**: Logs "Internet is connected, but DNS is not working." and displays a warning notification.
- **No Internet**: Logs "No internet connection." and displays an error notification.

## **Customizing the Script**
1. **Log File Path**:
   - Modify the `LOG_FILE` variable in the script to change the log file location.

2. **Notification Icon**:
   - Update the `ICON` variable in the `check_connection` function to use custom icons.

## **Scheduling with Cron**
To check the connection periodically:
1. Open the crontab editor:
   ```bash
   crontab -e
   ```
2. Add a line to run the script every 5 minutes:
   ```bash
   */5 * * * * DISPLAY=:0 /path/to/checker.sh
   ```
